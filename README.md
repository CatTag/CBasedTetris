# C Based Tetris
This is a clone of NES Tetris written in C.                                                            
It is not very high quality but it has a simple "UI" but it functions as Tetris.

# Controls
Left, Right, and Down arrows to move the block and you can also hold them.                            
Z and X to rotate.                                                                  Space to pause.                                                                         



# Build guide
Linux/MacOS:                                                                            
1. Install raylib from your package manger (pacman -S raylib on arch).                   
2. Compile using your C compiler of choice (gcc -lraylib -lm used for testing).               
3. chmod +x the output file and have fun :)                                                 

Windows:                                                                                              
Don't know and don't really care. You need raylib and a c compiler so good luck i guess.
